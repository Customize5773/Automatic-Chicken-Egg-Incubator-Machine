# Automatic-Chicken-Egg-Incubator-Machine

## Introduction ðŸ“š
In line with the rapid development of modern times, the demand for animal protein among the population has significantly increased. Population growth and modernization have driven the need for more efficient and innovative production methods. However, conventional methods of hatching chicken eggs are still widely used, despite their relatively low success rate. This condition has sparked the search for alternative solutions to improve overall efficiency in the hatching process.

This is where the application of chicken egg incubators comes into play as an innovative option. These machines are designed to carry out the hatching process without direct involvement from the hen, enabling automated and integrated monitoring and control. Such technological approaches are expected not only to increase the number of successfully hatched eggs but also to extend the harvest period, positively impacting productivity and production efficiency.

Furthermore, the implementation of incubator technology provides an opportunity for critical evaluation of traditional hatching systems. By adopting the latest technologies, various challenges that have hindered the optimization of the hatching process, such as initial investment costs and system maintenance, can be addressed. In-depth academic discourse on this innovation also opens avenues for further research on automation mechanisms in farming, allowing the continuous adaptation of such technologies to meet the needs of the industry and society at large.
