# Egg Incubator Experiment: Daily Log Dataset
[Charts](Incubator_21_Day_Trends.png) ðŸ“Š

This dataset contains detailed daily observations collected over a 21-day egg incubation experiment. An egg incubator is a machine designed to create the optimal environment for hatching eggs, involving precise control of various factors such as temperature, humidity, airflow, and egg rotation. The primary objective of recording this data is to monitor and maintain the ideal conditions for successful incubation.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset logs six key parameters recorded multiple times throughout each day:

### 1. **Timestamp**
   - Captures the exact date and time of each observation.

### 2. **Temperature (Temp Â°C)**
   - Records the incubator's temperature in Celsius.
   - Maintaining a stable and warm temperature is crucial for proper egg development.

### 3. **Humidity (%)**
   - Measures the air's moisture content inside the incubator.
   - Ensures the eggs lose moisture at the appropriate rate for healthy hatching.

### 4. **Heater Status**
   - Indicates whether the incubator's heater was **ON** or **OFF**.
   - Plays a direct role in temperature regulation.

### 5. **Vent Position**
   - Notes whether the incubator's air vent was **Open** or **Closed**.
   - Airflow management impacts both temperature and humidity.

### 6. **Egg Turned**
   - Specifies whether the eggs were rotated at the time of observation (**Yes** or **No**).
   - Regular turning prevents the embryo from sticking to the shell and supports healthy development.
