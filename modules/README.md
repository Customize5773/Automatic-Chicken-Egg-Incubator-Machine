# Egg Turning Automation with Servo Motor

This code is designed to automate the turning of eggs at regular intervals using a servo motor. It can be used in applications like incubators, where eggs need to be rotated periodically to ensure proper development.

## Features
- **Servo Control**: Utilizes a servo motor attached to the specified GPIO pin to perform the egg-turning action.
- **Time-Based Rotation**: Eggs are rotated every 6 hours by default, but the interval can be customized.
- **Simple and Efficient**: Uses the Arduino platform and requires minimal hardware setup.

## How It Works
1. **Setup**:
   - The servo motor is attached to `EGG_TURNING_SERVO_PIN` (Pin 22).
   - The servo initializes at its starting position (0°).

2. **Logic**:
   - The code checks the elapsed time since the last rotation using the `millis()` function.
   - If the elapsed time exceeds the defined interval (`TURN_INTERVAL`), the servo toggles between two positions (0° and 180°) to turn the eggs.

3. **Customizable Timer**:
   - Adjust the turning interval by modifying the `TURN_INTERVAL` constant in milliseconds.
   - Examples:
     - 6-hour rotation: `6 * 60 * 60 * 1000` (Default: 21,600,000 ms)
     - 12-hour rotation: `12 * 60 * 60 * 1000` (43,200,000 ms)

## Code Snippet Example
```cpp
#define EGG_TURNING_SERVO_PIN 22
Servo eggServo;

// Timing for egg turning
unsigned long lastTurnTime = 0;
const unsigned long TURN_INTERVAL = 6UL * 60UL * 60UL * 1000UL; // Turn every 6 hours
bool turnState = false;

void setup() {
  eggServo.attach(EGG_TURNING_SERVO_PIN);
  eggServo.write(0); // Start position
}

void loop() {
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
  if (currentMillis - lastTurnTime > TURN_INTERVAL) {
    turnState = !turnState;
    eggServo.write(turnState ? 180 : 0); // Flip position
    lastTurnTime = currentMillis;
  }
}
```

## How to Use
1. Connect the servo motor to Pin 22 or update the `EGG_TURNING_SERVO_PIN` with your desired GPIO pin.
2. Upload the code to your microcontroller.
3. Modify `TURN_INTERVAL` if a different rotation frequency is needed.
4. Power your setup and watch the servo rotate at the specified intervals.
